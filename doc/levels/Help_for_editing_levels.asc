;   SYMBOLS AND THEIR MEANING IN THE LEVEL-CODE -----------+

;   CREATURES:
;   P = player  = Mc Minos
;   G = ghost 1 = White Ghost  (properties: see below)
;   g = ghost 2 = Pill Layer   (       "         "   )
;   H = ghost 3 = Bad Ghost    (       "         "   )
;   h = ghost 4 = Jumping Pill)
                                (properties: see below)
;   BUILDINGS:
;   C = Castle of the Ghosts
;       A complete castle must always look like this:
;           CC
;           CC
;   The maximum count of castles is 64 per level!

;   ELEMENTS OF THE MAZE:
;   X = wall
;   Z = undestroyable wall
;   U = invisable wall
;   D = door, closed
;   | = door, opened
;   F = speed-Up field
;   f = speed-Down field
;   W = warp hole
;   A = Kill All Field
;   ^, >, v, < = one way fields
;   ä, ö, ü, ß = rotating one ways
;                preset one way directions:
;                ä=up, ö=right, ü=down, ß=left
;   T = skull field
;   S = skull
;   ? = surprise field (positive or negative)
;   r = rock
;   O = rock me field
;   0 = rock me field with a stone on it
;   6, 7, 8, 9, o = holes in the ground,
;                (6 = smallest, o = biggest)

;   USEFUL THINGS:
;   . = Pill
;   x = ladder - is now a field with an upstairs exit symbol
;   a = kill all pill

;   power pills: (do their job for 10 sec)
;   * = ~~apple~~ -> cookie; multipliers: MCSPEED *= 2; GHSPEEDs *= 1
;   ( = mushroom; multipliers: MCSPEED *= 1; GHSPEEDs *= 2
;   ) = ~~bonbon~~ -> milk; multipliers: MCSPEED *= 1; GHSPEEDs *= 1

;   L = Live
;   $ = clock, Level time (if level time is limited:) + 60 sec.
;   c = Letter with level code

;   Boni:
;   1 = Bonus 100 Pt
;   2 = Bonus 250 Pt
;   3 = Bonus 500 Pt

;   BAD THINGS:
;   w = Whisky
;   M = mirror
;   p = poison; can be cured with medicine

;   TOOLS:
;   k = key
;   b = bomb
;   d = dynamite
;   _ = mine (nicht aktivated)
;   , = mine in the ground (aktivated)
;   + = chocolate = power pill to be carried until needed);
        multipliers: MCSPEED *= 2; GHSPEEDs *= 1
        (does it's job for: 10 s)
;   m = medicine (bottle of)
;   u = umbrella
