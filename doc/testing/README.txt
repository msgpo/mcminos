McMinos mobile/desktop is currently in alpha stage. There are bugs. The
functionallity and game levels have not yet been fully implemented/selected.
Quite a lot may yet change. But McMinos is already playable for testing
purposes.

For your first go at McMinos we suggest you try out the tutorial levels,
currenly shown at the top of the preliminary level list in the game. They
introduce many elements of the game step by step. Most of them are easy to
play, and also a nice testing area.

There are two variants up for testing:


desktop-1.0.jar
===============

This is obviously the desktop version. It requires Java 1.7 or higher.

On a Windows system with properly installed Java, it should suffice to
double-click the jar file.

On Linux, have Oracle Java JRE or JDK installed (OpenJDK should work, too). To
start, open a shell, cd to the directory where you put desktop-1.0.jar, and run
"java -jar desktop-1.0.jar". You may of course put this in a script create a
mcminos.desktop file for your convenience.


android-release.apk
===================

This the Android version. If you open this from within a file manager on your
Android device (min. dual core cpu, 1GB RAM), the usual installation procedure
is automatically started.


Playing the game
================

In the level, the following actions are possible:

Move McMinos
------------

* press arrow keys or, alternatively, the keys [A], [W], [S], [D]
  (desktop only)

* click/(touchscreen: tap) ahead of McMinos to set where McMinos shall move.
* (Android only:) using the square in the corner like a joystick (touch left
  of the central dot to move left, etc.)

Open or close the toolbox
-------------------------

* double click (touchscreen: double tap)
* press [Space] key (desktop only)

Zoom in and out on the levels
-----------------------------

* move mouse wheel (desktop)
* [+] and [-] keys (desktop)
* (+) and (-) buttons in the toolbox

(This file is under construction. Let me know if anything sucks.)
