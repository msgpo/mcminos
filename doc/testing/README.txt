McMinos mobile/desktop is currently in alpha stage. There are bugs. The
functionallity and game levels have not yet been fully implemented/selected.
Quite a lot may change yet. But McMinos is already playable for testing
purposes.

For your first go at McMinos we suggest you try out the tutorial levels,
currenlty shown at the top of the preliminary level list in the game. They
introduce many elements of the game step by step. Most of them are easy to
play, and also a nice testing area.

There are two variants up for testing:


desktop-1.0.jar
===============

This is obviously the desktop version. It requires Oracle Java 7 or higher.

On a Windows system with properly installed Java, it should suffice to
double-click the jar file.

On Linux, have Oracle Java JRE or JDK installed (OpenJDK â©¾ 7 should work, too).
To start McMinos, open a shell, cd to the directory where you put
desktop-1.0.jar, and run "java -jar desktop-1.0.jar". You may of course put
this in a script create a mcminos.desktop file for your convenience.


android-release.apk
===================

This is the Android version. Download this to your android device. Open a file
manager and tap this file. Android will offer you to install the program.
Accept. Wait a few seconds. Play.

Minimum hardware requirements for Android
-----------------------------------------

* dual core CPU, min. 1.2 GHz
* 1GB RAM
* ~ VGA display (640x600 pixels)


Playing the game
================

In the level, the following actions are possible:

Move McMinos
------------

* (desktop only): press arrow keys or the keys [A], [W], [S], [D]

* click/(touchscreen: tap) ahead of McMinos to set where McMinos shall move.

* (Android only:) using the square in the corner like a joystick (touch left
  of the central dot to move left, etc.)

Open or close the toolbox
-------------------------

* double click (touchscreen: double tap)
* (desktop only:) press [Space] key

Zoom in and out on the levels
-----------------------------

* (desktop:) move mouse wheel 
* (desktop:) [+] and [-] keys
* (+) and (-) buttons in the toolbox's menu

Use items from the toolbox
--------------------------

The toolbox presents items you collected in the level. Chocolate, bombs,
medicine etc. To activate, just click (touchscreen: tap) any of them once.

Availavle levels
================

The level list is currently quite volatile. It's current content consists of:

* testing/ - a couple of test levels, not necessarily suitable for normal playing.

* new/ - latest additions; currently the original levels of the first ATARI release of McMinos (1993). Quite playable, actually.

* green/ - evaluated and selected levels, good for playing, of variable difficulty, yet unsorted

* yellow/ - evaluated levels that may require editing and testing and may still be removed fromm the list

* blue/ - evaluated levels we consider quite difficult to play
