McMinos mobile is currently in alpha stage. There are bugs. Some features are
not yet implemented. We are in the process of editing and selecting levels. A
lot may change yet. But McMinos is well playable for testing purposes.

If you are a first-time player, we recommend that you try the tutorial levels,
currently shown at the top of the level list in the game's main menu. The 
tutorial levels introduce many elements of the game step by step. Most of them 
are easy to play, and also a nice testing area.


android-release.apk
===================

This is the install archive for Android devices (mobile phones, tablets, etc.).
Download this to your android device. Open a file manager and tap this file.
Android will offer you to install the program. Accept. Wait a few seconds.
Play.

Minimum hardware requirements for McMinos for Android
-----------------------------------------------------

* dual core CPU, min. 1.2 GHz
* 1GB RAM
* ~ VGA display (640x600 pixels)

Most devices bought 2012 or later should fullfil these requirements

Playing the game
================

In the level, the following actions are possible:

Move McMinos
------------

* tap ahead of McMinos to set where McMinos shall move.

* use the square "touchpad" in the corner like a joystick (push the little dot 
in the center to the left of the pad's center to move left, to the right of the 
center to move right, and so on)

Open or close the toolbox
-------------------------

* tap the settings button on the toolbox

Zoom in and out on the levels
-----------------------------

* (+) and (-) buttons in the toolbox's menu
* two-finger zoom-in and zoom-out swipes, but currently hard due to the large 
  zoom steps.

Use items from the toolbox
--------------------------

The toolbox presents items you collected in the level. Chocolate, bombs,
medicine etc. To activate, just click (touchscreen: tap) any of them once.

If you are positioned next to more than one door, the key offers a selection.
Alternatively, you can double tap a door next to McMinos directly, without 
selecting a key first.

Explosives will always be dropped ignited/activated.

Available levels
================

The level list is currently quite volatile. It's current content consists of:

* testing/ - a couple of test levels, not necessarily suitable for normal 
  playing.

* new/ - latest additions; currently the original levels of the first ATARI 
  release of McMinos (1993). Quite playable, actually.

* green/ - evaluated and selected levels, good for playing, of variable 
  difficulty, yet unsorted

* yellow/ - evaluated levels that may require editing and testing and may still 
  be removed fromm the list

* blue/ - evaluated levels we consider quite difficult to play
