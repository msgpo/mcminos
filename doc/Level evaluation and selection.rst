After my opinion we should drop all peep-hole levels (VWID, WHI much smaller than the actual level dimensions), unless they are fun when played with the peep-hole removed. Please add your comments.

Test levels for development
===========================

* testing — not in release, just for testing


Tutorial levels
===============

All tutorial levels should be 7x7 fiels in size. 
Except the last ones they don't have scrolling.

Seeing we have now 17 tutorial levels available


* tut01-pills

  * pills only, no ghost
  * very easy; should help absolute beginners understand what is going on

* tut02-ghost-hanky

  * introducing ghost hanky; pills, 1 apple, 1 ghost (with castle)
  * relatively easy (don't know about absolute beginners)

* tut03-chocolate

  * introduces the toolbox via chocolate
  * quite easy: offers fun time hunting the ghosts as there is much more chocolate than required.

* tut04-doors-and-keys

  * getting to know tools with directional use via keys
  * very easy

* tut05-rock-and-rock-me

  * introduces properties and uses of rocks (except resistance to bombs, but not dynamite)
  * introduces rock-me fields and there equivalence to pills regarding level fulfilment

* tut06-jumping-pills

  * very easy

* tut07-bombs

  * introduces explosives; shows, that chain reactions can be initiated
  * very easy

* tut08-holes

  * easy, I guess
  
* tut09-warp-holes

  * just to understand how warp holes work, and that ghosts (1 jpill) can go through, too.
  * very easy

* tut10-poison-and-medicine

  * very easy

* tut11-dynamite
  
  * chain exploisions, careful positioning of explosions and player
  * use 1 bomb to get rid of ghost (or run)
  * medium easy

* tut12-oneways

  * mixture of oneways, fix and rotatable
  * easy, but requires a little thinking - should we make this easier yet?

* tut13-mirror

  * introduces mirror + reverting effect of 2nd mirror (if used)
  * very easy with a little careful maneuvering

* tut14-speed-up-and-down-killall-field

  * very easy one way maze, can be played in seconds

* tut16-exit-and-enter

  * introduce level exits and entries (no scrolling of the level)
  * medium difficulty

* tut17-infinite-world

  * medium difficulty, may be a little too difficult for a tutorial - it's currently the final tutorial level after all. Your call!
  


Old levels from the ATARI version
=================================

* level000
  
  * square symmetrical level, castle in the centre, 4 apples
  * A: quite difficult for a starter, rather put this somewhere later. - But then, there are no special effects, is it good enough?
  * A: may be we should simply reduce the size of this level (removing the outer ways)

* level001

  * sort of a wide screen level, 1 rock, pills, 3 apples, castle centred
  * A: medium difficulty

* level002

  * many vertical exits, no scrolling
  * A: quite difficult, especially the exits/entries - not sure if this is a good beginners level

* level003

  * jpills-only level, 1 apple(!), kill-all-ghosts-field
  * A: easy, fun

* level004
  
  * doors + keys level from ATARI version 0.8.15
  * A: medium to high difficulty, could do it yet on the desktop, nor on the tablet, possibly too difficult?

* level005

  * simply a maze with pills and few apples
  * A: medium or higher difficulty; lost 2 lives at first attempt before finishing
  * A: too monotone, eating pills - do we need more fun elements in the level(s)?

* level006

  * peep-hole-level with explosives, jpills, ...
  * peep-hole needs to go
  * A: medium difficulty; requires some thinking

* level007

  * square level with many doors; player has to move from the centre to the outer edge opening and closing doors at the right time to keep the ghosts away
  * A: high difficulty, lots of fun, IIRC - but didn't manage to leave the first chamber without dying now (desktop).

* level008

  * little square pills level with 4 extra rocks. nothing special.
  * A: medium difficulty

* level009

  * wide-screen level, jpills and rocks
  * A: simple; good enough?

* level010

  * very wide level, pills, one-ways
  * A: easy, a little boring; any idea how to spice it up?
  
* level011

  * (yet non-scrolling) infinite-world level with sparse walls, jpills, rocks
  * should be scrolling x+y
  * A: medium difficulty - requires a radar screen or a large-enough display

* level012

  * level 1 of ATARI version 0.8.15, square, small, 1 exit/entry pair, hanky
  * but had zarathustra instead of hanky - reverted that
  * A: easy

* level013

  * evil brain teaser with holes, pills and rocks, no ghosts
  * A: difficult - too difficult for our target group?

* level014

  * extremely wide x-scrolling level  
  * A: yet unplayed

* level015

  *

  * A: doesn't look very promising to me. My vote: remove

* level031

  * zarathustra, dynamite and rocks
  * A: relatively difficult

* level032

  * is this not the level one user on Atari took two weeks to solve?
  * much fun, brain teaser
  * A: difficult

* level033
* level034
* level035
* level036

  * extremely wide level, funny idea, but not finished
  * A: easy but pointless, except as a joke; should be finished/fixed or dropped.

* level037
  
  * big level, many tasks, hanky, jpill, zarathustra
  * A: difficult, but interesting

* level038
* level039

  * large square maze with pills, ghosts, skulls

  * square level with four quarter squares, mines, no ghosts, 1 imprisoned jpill + 1 corresponding bomb
  * one quarter square with rotating oneways gets McMinos stuck
  * A: medium difficulty, no fun => remove
