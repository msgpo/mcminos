0.	Prologue
	or: At the Bottom ...
**********************************************


In a hole in the ground there lived a young
programmer. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole,
filled with the ends of worms and an oozy
smell, nor yet a dry, bare sandy hole with
nothing in it to sit down on or to eat - no,
not that.

This particular hole was equipped with
comfortable furniture, had a large, whitish
table in it (a bit worn after years of work)
and - last but not in the least least - an
ATARI computer.

The young programmer used to spend nights on
end in front of his beloved computer's screen,
hacking cryptic character sequences on the
keyboard, which - after careful reading -
turned out to be far more cryptic source codes
of absolutely incomprehensible meaning.
Surprisingly (not to the young programmer, of
course) all that code made sense.

With deadly accuracy the young programmer
hacked his way through the routine jungle of
TOS, down there at the bottom of the System,
from where no process has returned so far. He
used routines of a speed unheard-off which
produced wonderful effects on the screen (or
elsewhere). That's why people called him "The
Wizard of TOS".

Together with a rather less ingenious computer
artist (who often drove the young programmer
crazy with ever another dead stupid idea) the
young programmer planned and hacked and
patched - and in the end the two of them had
done another brilliant computer game.

They played it, they had terrific fun with it
and they called it ...

3.	General Introduction to the Game:
**********************************************


McMinos is a new and brilliant game wich puts
the idea of a classic computer game in a
modern form. It is featured with many special
effects.

You (the player) are a small, ball-shaped
lifeform that has to make its way through vast
labyrinths on the quest after a dreadful,
man-eating dragon.

You can move that pixel incarnation of yours
by help of a joystick (in port 1) or by the
use of the following keys of your keyboard:

ииииииииииииинииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии
Joystick	 к Tastatur
ииииииииииииилииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии
Up:			 к , 8 (numeric keys)
Right:		 к , 6 (     "      )
Down:	     к , 2 (     "      )
Left:	     к , 4 (     "      )
Fire Button: к    5 (     "      ),
			 к SPACE, RETURN, INSERT
ииииииииииииипииииииииииииииииииииииииииииииии

By help of the firebutton (or one of the
respective keys on your keyboard) McMinos can
get tools out of the toolbox and use them in
the level. 
\I6#For detailed information see chapter 6 [].

(NEWS: After having spent another long night
in front of his beloved ATARI, The Wizard of
TOS has just informed me, that now you can
even use the mouse to play McMinos!!!

Many dangers are waiting for you. But here and
there, you will find tools (and friends) that
make your task easier for a while. Avoid the
ghosts for they want to eat you.

A level is (in most cases) done if you have
eaten all the pills in the labyrinth.

5.	The Level Menu
**********************************************


When you start playing you will find the
screen divided in two parts. On the left side
a square of a minimum of 400*400 pixels
shows a part of the current level. The right
part of the screen shows diverse informative
elements.

On top there is a display of your actual
scores:

\K157#\u@	Score
\d@
\K158#\uV	Level Number
\dV
\K159#\uL	Lives
\dL
\K160#\u$	Level Time
\d$
\K161#\uщ	Special Effect Time
\dщ

Beneath the scores there is the tool box. You
enter the tool box by pressing the fire
button. After selecting the desired tool by
scrolling up and down with the joystick
pressing the firebutton generally activates
\I6#the tool. See chapter 6 [], too.

The bottom part of the Menu is occupied by a
level map. Since the most levels are to vast
to be displayed on the screen in original size
the level map allows you to find out where
exactly you are - and where ghosts, tools or
other things are waiting for you.

6.	The Toolbox
**********************************************

In the toolbox you'll find a couple of useful
things waiting for you - if you have collected
them in the labyrinths before, that is.

To enter the toolbox (menu) simply press the
firebutton while playing a level. You can
select items by scrolling up and down with the
joystick until the little arrow on the left is
pointing at the desired tool. To eventually
use the tool, generaly press the firebutton
again. (Exeptions are explained in the
respective paragraph.)

By the way: the number behind any of the tools
tells you how many of this specific tool you
own at the moment. If the desired tool is not
available, nothing happens when you press the
fire button.

You can also use all tools and select the 
options without entering the toolbox by using 
the respective function keys or other keys as 
displayed in the toolbox.

There are following tools or options to be 
chosen from:



\K150#\u{ Fire button opens
\d{ the toolbox

To open the toolbox, press the firebutton.
The game is interrupted until you leave the
toolbox again. Entering the toolbox offers
you the chance to have a break.



\K151#\u} Leave the       ESC
\d} toolbox

Selecting this option closes the toolbox.
The game goes on AT ONCE.



\K127#\uk Key   CTRL \u
\dk 000        \d
(20 points for collecting a key)

With a key you can open a door (that's what
keys are made for ...). Collect keys, whenever
you find them and use them when you need to.

To open a door, position McMinos in front of 
the door, select the key in the toolbox and 
press the firebutton or move the joystick  to 
the right. The arrow on the left jumps to the 
 right side of the key. Move the joystick to 
the side in which McMinos finds  the door, 
then press the firebutton again. Now the door 
is open.

To shut a door again use another key just the 
same way.

A faster way of opening/closing a door is to 
use the CONTROL key and then select the 
direction in wich McMinos finds the door by 
help of the CURSOR keys. The door opens/ 
closes as soon as you press the respective 
CURSOR key.



\K129#\ub Bomb    F1 \uBF1
\db 000        \dB
(20 points for collecting a bomb, 50 points
for each ghost killed)

A bomb kills any life form within a distance
of 1 field:

	***
	*b*
	***

To lay a bomb, select the bomb in the toolbox
and scroll to the right side so that the
little arrow is pointing at the ignited bomb
and press the fire button. Run away after
laying it!

If you want to put a bomb down anywhere in the
level, just select the not ignited bomb symbol
in the toolbox and press the fire button.



\K130#\ud DynamiteF2 \uYF2
\dd 000        \dY
(20 points for collecting dynamite,
50 points for each ghost killed)

Destroys walls, doors, rocks and all live
forms within a distance of 1 field:

    ***
    *d*
    ***

Use of dynamite is analogue to the bomb. Run
away after igniting dynamite!



\K131#\u_ Mine    F3 \u,F3
\d_ 000        \d,
(20 points for collecting a mine,
50 points for each ghost killed)

Mines in the ground are a bad thing: Don't
walk on them - they instantly kill you (and
all other lifeforms within a distance of one
field):

	***
	*m*
	***

Mines, not dug into the ground, are a fine
thing: You can collect them and dig them in
where they prevent the ghosts from catching
you.

Use of Mines is analogue to the bomb, too.



\K133#\u+ Chocolate	       F4
\d+ 000
Portable Power Pill
(20 points for collecting a chocolate)

Has the same Effect like one of the other
\I120#power pills []. Only you don't have to use it
when you walk over it. You carry it away in
the toolbox and use it, when the time comes.



\K134#\um Medicine		   F5
\dm 000
(20 points + 10 points for successful use)

Cures you from the bad effects of drinking
from a bottle of poison.



\K135#\uu Umbrella         F6
\du 000
(20 points for collecting an umbrella)

Can be used as a "parachute" to fly over a
hole in the level ground.



\K152#\uE View Level       F7
\dE

If you select this option, you can have a 
close look at any part of the level, 
scrolling through the vast level area. To 
resume the game just press the fire button.



\K162#\u~ Centre    CapsLock
\d~ McMinos: OFF

The level area visible on the screen is 
scrolled whenever neccessary, so that you 
always know, where McMinos is running.
	If you have selected "Centre McMinos", 
the program continuously tries to put McMinos 
as near to the centre of the displayed level 
area as is possible. If this option is 
switched off, the respective area is only 
scrolled when McMinos approaches its edges.

The best will be, you just try it out.

By the way, while playing with the "Centre 
McMinos" funcition switched off you can still 
centre McMinos by pressing the "ClrHome" key.



\K163#\u Sounds and       S
\d music: OFF

If you don't like the sounds in McMinos 
program, you can switch the noises off
even while you are playing.
	Should you, lateron, miss them you can 
switch them on again. To switch while 
playing, press the key [S].



\K153#\uд Suicide;; -1 F8
\dд

You lose one life and restart playing from the
Startposition of the actual level.



\K154#\u Restart level;;   F9
\d reset scores;; -1

You restart the level. All scores (points,
tools) are reset to the old values. But then
you lose one of your lives because restarting
the level includes committing suicide.



\K155#\u╛ Save game and  F10
\d╛ exit           ESC

If you select this option, the game is
aborted. The actual situation in the level and
all settings and scores of yours are saved in
a file. Thus you can restart the game lateron.
\I800#See chapter 4 [], too.



\K156#\u╗ Abandon game     Q
\d╗ (WITHOUT saving it)

The game is aborted and all data concerning it
abandoned. So you CANNOT restart it again!

\K102#\uX	Wall
\dX

You can't walk through walls. Some ghosts can.
But with the proper tools even you may
sometimes make your own way through walls.



\K103#\uZ	Undemolishable Wall
\dZ

These Wall pieces cannot be demolished.
Neither you nor the ghosts can get through
them.



\K104#\uU	Invisible Wall
\dU

Sometimes it can happen, that McMinos can't
walk on in this or that direction, though
nothing can be seen that might hinder him.
THIS IS NO BUG!

Probably some nasty level author has built up
an invisible wall to irritate you.



\K105#\uD	Door
\dD

To walk through a door, you've got to open it
\I127#with a key []. To shut it again, use another
key.



\K106#\uF	Speed Up Field
\dF

Walking over a speed up field accelerates
McMinos by the factor 2 (unless the highest
possible speed is already activated).



\K107#\uf	Speed Down Field
\df

A speed down field has an effect opposite to
that of the speed up field (see above).

If McMinos walks on a warp field, it says
"warp", swallows McMinos and he returns to the
levels surface out of another wrap field in
the same level.



\K109#\ua	Kill All Field 
\da	(30 points per ghost) 

If you walk on such a field, all ghosts are
instantly killed! 



\K110#\u^	\u>	\uv	\u<
\d^	\d>	\dv	\d<
Oneway Fields

Oneway Fields can be walked on from any
direction - but they can only be left in the
direction, the arrow is pointing to.



\K111#\u└	\u■	\u│	\u·
\d└	\d■	\d│	\d·
Rotating Oneways

These oneways rotate clockwise by 90 degrees
any time McMinos walks on them. Ghosts rotate
them by random.



\K113#\u6\u7	The Castle
\d6\d7
\u8\u9
\d8\d9

The Ghosts live in the castle. They reappear
from there if you have eaten them. But be
careful: In some levels ghosts may start not
from the castle but from where the level
author put them. They will generaly restart
from there, if you have lost a life.



\K114#\uS	Skull
\dS

Walking on a skull costs you 1 life.



\K115#\u?	Surprise
\d?

Anything can happen if you walk on a
"surprise" field.



\K128#\ur	Rock
\dr

You can push rocks out of your way. You should
rather not push those heavy items over a hole
in the ground!



\K136#\uO	Rock Me Field
\dO

If you find such fields in a level, push a
rock on any of them to do the level.



\K116#\u	\u	\u	\u	\u
\d	\d	\d	\d	\d
Hole

Here and there the level ground has not been
properly plastered. So it can happen that a
hole appears. Don't walk over it to often, for
it grows bigger and bigger. 

If you walk over a big hole without an
umbrella, you fall through - back to the
previous level.

If a ghost walks over a whole, it falls back
to the previous level, too (ghosts have no
umbrellas, you see).



\K165#\u╩	Cross
\d╩

This is where McMinos has lost one of his 
lives earlier in the game.

9.	Good Things on Your Way
**********************************************


Many things are lying here and there in the
labyrinths. Some of them are good to eat, some
of them are not.

This chapter tells you about the good items:



\K117#\u.	Pill
\d.	(1 point)

Eat all pills in your way to do the levels.



\K118#\ux	Ladder
\dx	(0 points)

This is probably the best thing to find in a
level: A ladder leeds you directly to the
following level.



\K119#\uA	Kill All Pill
\dA	(30 points per ghost)

If you eat such a pill, all ghosts are
instantly killed!



\K120#\u*	\u(	\u)	\u/	\u-
\d*	\d(	\d)	\d/	\d-
Power Pills (20 points each)

They enable you to eat the ghosts. Some of
them make you faster as well, and with others
not only you, but the ghosts, too, get faster.
Their effect lasts for a specific number of
seconds.



\K121#\uL	Extra Life
\dL	(20 points)

You receive a new life every 5000 points.
Sometimes you find a life lying somewhere on
your way.



\K122#\u$	Stopwatch
\d$	(20 points)

Adds 60 seconds to your level time.
;
;
;
;	\K123#\u!	Present
;	\d!
;
;	If you walk over one of the nicely wrapped
;	presents it turns into one of the more
;	pleasant items - like a power pill, bomb, key,
;	life, etc.



\K132#\uc	Secret Letter
\dc	(20 points)

In a secret letter you find a secret number
wich gives you direct access to the actual
level the next time you play "McMinos".

In each of the directories containing the 
level data (of Versions 0.815 and 1.10 etc.) 
you find another directory with several level 
tables inside. You can print these with your 
printer and fill in the secret level codes 
when you find them while playing new levels.

The aktual file names of the tables you find 
in the file README.ASC. This file provides a 
list of all the files belonging to the 
McMinos system. 



\K112#\u1	\u2	\u3	\u4	\u5
\d1	\d2	\d3	\d4	\d5
Bonus (100 to 500 points)

A bonus is never too bad, is it? And it makes
sure you climb higher in the highscore table.



REMARK: For those things you can collect and
\I6#carry along in the toolbox, see chapter 6 [].

10.	Bad Things on Your Way
**********************************************


This chapter - as you will presumably imagine
- shows you most of the items you should
rather avoid:



\K124#\uw	Whisky
\dw	(20 points)

It is not good for you to drink alcohol,
McMinos! You get drunk and run about
uncontrolably for a while.



\K125#\up	Poison
\dp	(0 points)

Don't drink of this bottle! It's poisonous! If
you did drink from it by accident you can save
your life by use of the proper medicine.



\K126#\uM	Mirror
\dM	(20 points)

Walking over a mirror causes McMinos to walk
to exactly the opposite direction you want him
to. Walking over a second mirror returns
McMinos to a resonable moving mode again.



\K137#\u,	Mine in the Ground

\I131#See the paragraph about mines [] in
chapter 6.

\K501#UNFORTUNATELY we've got to mention GALACTIC 
and DIGIT here. That's because they demand it 
in their license agreements. We'd rather not.


**********************************************
I've never had so much trouble (@╩╗..У╡Х*б!)
with a software label. [Nor had I! NoPe]
**********************************************


So take heed of the horror story:

I wanted to produce a reasonably good sound 
in the opening of McMinos without having to 
write another bunch of nervewrecking 
functions. So I decided to rely on a 
professional program. I chose the Digit 
program, published by Galactic.

The trouble even began with the order. They 
didn't send the program within a week, as 
they agreed to do on the phone. I had to wait 
for four weeks.

Well, that might not have troubled me, if 
then I could have started to work with the 
program. But, as it turned out to be, there 
was a very grave bug hidden in the program.

So i contacted Galactic again and I was told 
that, well, it might be that here and there a 
bug was hiding in the program, for it was a 
new version and they had not tested this 
version yet!!!

I bade them, politely, to send a debugged 
version which I eventually received three 
weeks later after having suggested to bring 
my lawyer into the matter. This time, to my 
surprise, the music editor really worked.

But the music-playing bindings for own 
programs were suffering from a bunch of bugs. 
The quality of sounds on the ST was 
unbearable and, as it seemed, Digit had never 
heared of the TT FAST-RAM.

Eventually I patched the binding routines 
myself and ...

	two hard months later I had finally 	
	erased or outwitted all the bugs!!!

[I can tell! For I'm the one who had had to 
comfort TWoT on the phone, when yet another 
bug was wrecking the remains of his nerves.]

As you can well hear yourself in the opening 
of McMinos, the remains of the bindings do 
work now.

Dear Uli,

it's real fun to work on a project like 
McMinos together with you!
First, because no bug  ( \uЫ ) is hideous 
enough not to be caught by you one day (under 
your skillfull hands programming becomes a 
sort of saucery).
	Second, because even in the worst 
situations you've always kept your good 
humour.

Thanx a bundle for that great team-work! Let 
me tell you I'm looking forward to work on 
further projects together with you!
