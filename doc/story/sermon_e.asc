\_PLUSTOOLS:
6\#
;
In the forest you discover a ruined cottage. 
You take a look inside and find some useful 
things (probably forgotten by another 
wanderer).\#
;
You meet a friendly peasant. You tell him of 
your quest. He wants to help you and out of 
his bundle he presents you some things.\#
;
You've met a wizard. He was very nice and 
presented you some useful things.\#
;
Under a bush you discover a dirty, torn 
leather satchel. You drag it out and in it 
you find several items you chose to take with 
you:\#
;
A friendly peasant gives you a bed for the 
night and a substantial breakfast. When you 
bid him farewell in the morning he even 
presents you a bunch of helpful items to help 
you on your quest.\#
;
Deep at night a witch puts a spell on you and 
abducts you to her hide-out. In the morning, 
you wake up caught in a cage. You can't move 
a great deal. But when she comes to feed you, 
you jump on her and kill the nasty witch. 
Strolling around in her hide-out you find 
some useful things.\#
;
;
\_MINTOOLS:
5\#
;
You're climbing throug a dangerous ravine. 
Suddenly a packhorse loses a heavy bundle. 
Important tools are gone.\#
;
A horrible thunder storm is raging. One of 
your pack horses fled. Important tools are 
lost.\#
;
Shit! Burglars have taken away many of your 
tools.\#
;
Crossing a fast-running river, balancing over 
a fallen tree, one of your bags falls into 
the water and is at once swallowed by a big 
fish.
This is what you lost with the bag:\#
;
What's happened now? When you wake up this 
morning a good part of your luggage is gone. 
Bloody burglars!!! That's what they've taken 
away from you.\#

together with a code tabel which enables you
