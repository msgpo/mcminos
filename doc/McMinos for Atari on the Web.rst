A VERY GREAT THANK YOU TO A MAN WHO TEACH ME WHAT ATARI ST/E IS IN LATE 80'S AND 90'S WITH THE PSEUDONYM "LALAOUNIS",THE "GREEK ATARI ST/E MASTER" (AND NOT ONLY) MILLION THANKS IN ADVANCE LALAOUNIS FOR ALL ATARI ST/E HAPPY COMPUTER MOMENTS AND BE GOOD.NASTE KALA KAI EYTYXISMENOI PANTA,GIORGO KAI MAIRH
TO KANALI AYTO EINAI AFIEROMENO SE ESAS

PURPOSE OF MY VIDEOS IS NEITHER "GAMEPLAYING SKILL" NEITHER TO "SHOW GOOD FRAMERATE" IN VIDEOS,NEITHER TO "SHOW THE BEST PROFESSIONAL VIDEO RESOLUTION",NEITHER TO "MAKE LONGPLAYS" NEITHER "PLAYING THROUGH" THE ORIGINAL AMIGA HARDWARE OR ATARI ST/E HARDWARE (VIDEO ARE ONLY FROM EMULATORS) BUT AGAIN THE PURPOSE OF THE VIDEOS IS TO "SEE" FOR "FEW MINUTES OF GAMEPLAY" OF "AMIGA AND ATARI ST/E" "YOUTUBE YET UNRELEASED GAMES (OR UTILITIES,DEMOS,SONGS,MENU INTROS,CRACKTROS AND SUCH STUFF BUT UNRELEASED - TILL TODAY).THE ONLY "EXCEPTION" FROM THIS ARE THE VIDEOS (WHICH ALREADY RELEASED TO YOUTUBE) ALTHOUGH I "ASK HELP" FROM OTHER RETRO USERS TO MADE "GAME LONGPLAYS".ALL THESE GAMES ARE "GOOD" GAMES OR "BAD" GAMES BUT ABOVE ALL WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT ALL ARE "GAMES" AND,OF COURSE,WE LOVE THEM ALL.VIDEOS ARE SMALL BUT "INSIDE VIDEO" EXCEPT FROM THE GAMEPLAY OF THE GAME YOU CAN FIND :

1) "GAME DEVELOPER" (GAME INTRO)
2) "GAME PUBLISHER" (GAME INTRO)
3) "MENU" DEVELOPER" (FOR ATARI ST GAMES - WHEN THE MENU STARTS)
4) TEAM WHO "CRACKS" GAME (INSIDE DECOMPACTER FROM ATARI ST OR IN THE AMIGA CRACKTRO)
5) VERSION OF UTILITY "CRACK TEAM" USES (AFTER GAME SELECTION IN MENU IN ATARI ST)
6) PROGRAMMER(S) WHO PROGRAMMED GAME (GAME START SCREEN, AND SOMETIMES EVEN IN "HIGH SCORE TABLE".
BUT IF YOU WANT MUCH MUCH MORE GAME INFORMATION THEN GO TO THESE SITES FOR PLENTY INFORMATION :

FOR COMMODORE AMIGA

AND FOR ATARI ST/E

http://www.atarimania.com/pgemainsoft...

ALSO IF YOU ARE A NORMAL (REAL MACHINE) OR VIRTUAL (EMULATORS) OR BOTH,ATARI STT/E FALCON USER CHOOSE NECESSARY THIS SITE IT HAS EVERYTHING YOU'LL NEED

http://atari.8bitchip.info/

Και επίσης,πολύ ενδιαφέρον Ελληνικό forum επιστροφής στο παρελθόν & επαναφοράς αναμνήσεων από τα παλιά computers,μ΄αυτά τα οποία ξεκινήσαμε από το 1983,ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, Commodore, Atari ST,Amiga,καθώς επίσης & παλιά συστήματα PC με MsDos,με οδηγίες επισκευής,βελτιώσεις τους και σημερινές αναβαθμίσεις τους.

ALSO,FOR BEST "PSEUDOCRT" RESULTS CHOOSE "360p" IN MY VIDEOS.PLEASE DONT CHOOSE 720p OR 1080p.THEY ARE BOTH THE WORST CHOICE,HERE
ALSO IN AMIGA WHEN I SAY IN THE TITLE "AMIGA OCS" OR "AMIGA ECS" OR "AMIGA AGA" MEANS THAT THE SPECIFIC GAME RUN AT LEAST IN THIS CHIPSET OR ABOVE (FOR EXAMPLE "AMIGA OCS" MEANS THAT GAME RUN ON "AMIGA OCS" (A1000,A500) (BUT "MAY BE" OR "MAY BE NOT" RUN ON "AMIGA ECS" OR "AMIGA AGA").ALSO WHEN I SAY FOR EXAMPLE "AMIGA ECS PLAY" OR "AMIGA AGA PLAY" MEANS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE "GAME IS LOADING IN AGA" BUT MAY BE WORKS ON AMIGA ECS OR EVEN ON AMIGA OCS WITH SOME UPGRADES (SUCH AS MORE "CHIP" MEMORY OR WITH "KICKSTART 2.0") THESE ARE SOME EXAMPLES THAT YOUTUBE VIDEOS FROM OTHER USERS DONT COUNT,SO I UPLOAD MY OWN VIDEO OF THESE SPECIFIC GAMES

1) THE GAME EXISTS IN ONLY ONE VIDEO UPLOAD BUT THE UPLOADER "TALKS CONTINOUSLY",THEN THIS IS USELESS FOR ME AND I UPLOAD THE SAME GAME WITHOUT SPEECH
2) IF ANOTHER GAME UPLOAD (ONE ONLY VIDEO) IS FROM EXTERNAL "BAD" CAMERA WITH BAD SOUND,THEN I UPLOAD IT,AGAIN BECAUSE THE OTHER VIDEO IS USELESS...ETC ETC.WELL,FOR ME THESE GAMES ARE NOT "EXISTS" ON YOUTUBE
3) ALSO IF THE GAME HAS "FAKE" MUSIC SUCH AS FOR HYPOTHETICAL EXAMPLE OF "PACMAN" WHICH IN THE VIDEO YOU HERE INSTEAD GAME AND SAPLES "SAMANTHA FOX",THEN THE GAME IS USELESS,AGAIN,FOR ME.
THE KEY TO NOT UPLOAD A GAME,IS NOT ONLY TO "EXIST IN YOUTUBE" BUT TO "EXIST IN THE RIGHT WAY IN YOUTUBE"
