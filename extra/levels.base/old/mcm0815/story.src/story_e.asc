\I000#The Start of the Quest\#
;
\K000#Deap in the Woods of Mandilgaroth there lives
a dreadful, man-eating 'Monster in the Woods
of Mandilgaroth'. Nowbody dares to hunt it
- until one day a foreign prince comes to
Mandilgaroth. McMinos is his name. When the
King promises him half of his country and the
hand of his (pretty) daughter, the prince
armes and goes into the woods ...\#
;
;
\I001#Round the Corner
They Are Waiting\#
;
\K001#You've done well on the first day of your
quest, Prince McMinos. Look, wether you can
survive the secound ...\#
;
;
\I002#The Bewitched Cottage\#
;
\K002#Deep in the wood you find an old
cottage. The roof has fallen in, the
windows are broken. You enter the cottage.
It has many small rooms. Dark creatures
seem to be lurking here and there. You look
for a save corner to hide in ...\#
;
;
\I003#The Narrow Passage\#
;
\K003#On the third day you come to a very narrow
passage. He discovers a board nailed to a
tree. "Trilwarthanan", it says, "15 Miles".\#
;
;
\I004#Someone Behind\#
;
\K004#Running allong the narrow path you suddenly
realise that someone is following behind. He
doesn't dare to look back and starts
to run ...\#
;
\I005#The Village of
Trilwarthanan\#
;
\K005#Finally you reach the outskirts of
Trilwarthanan, the only little town in the
vast lands of the Rotten Woods ...\#
;
;
\I006#The Castle Behind Rocks\#
;
\K006#Not much fun have you had in Trilwarthanan,
Prince Minos. You leave the town and turn
towards the Eastern Hills. On top of the
highest hill you see an old castle hidden
behind large rocks.

You climb up towards it ...\#
;
;
\I007#Keys and Doors\#
;
\K007#Having overwhelmed the devilish creatures
guarding the 'Castle behind Rocks' you enter.
Many doors in the hallway lead to little
Chambers,  small cubibles and great light
halls. On the walls bundles of keys are
hanging, old and dusty ...\#
;
;
\I008#The Labyrinth\#
;
\K008#Trees and bushes all around. You cannot see
which way to go. So you just start and try it
out ...\#
;
;
\I009#Hexagone\#
;
;\K009#Nasty creatures try to get you. Move on as
;fast as you can!\#
;
;
\I010#Four Stones\#

\K010#In front of you there are lying four pieces of
rock. Try and get them out of your way.\#
;
;
\I011#Bombing Harry\#
;
\K011#Be quick and clear the way of rocks!\#
;
;
\I012#Rocks 'n' Rocks
'n' Rocks ...\#
;
\K012#Is there any way?\#
;
;
\I013#Faster than the Wind\#
;
\K013#Run, run as fast as you can, Prince Minos!\#
;
;
\I014#The Chambers of
Wardinant Castle\#
;
\K014#Pooo! That was a fast hunt!

In the evening you arrive at Wardinant Castle,
an old building in the loneliness of the Dark
Woods. You knock. No answer. You knock again.
Still no answer. You knock a third time. There
is no answer again, so you enter the halls of
Cardinant Castle. Here and there doors lead to
chambers, but most of them are locked and
sealed. There seems to lay a curse on this
building. You turn around and want to leave
this dreadful place. But when you want to go
back outside you find that a bad spell keeps
you inside. So you walk on inside in search of
another way out ...\#
;
;
\I015#Down the Road\#
;
;
\K015#Luckily you escaped the dreadful Castle. Now
again you wander down the roads.\#
;
;
\I016#Run, Run Away\#
;
\K016#There is something behind. A sound. You turn
and discover a distressful creature in the
distance, aproaching you with a strange sound
escaping from his nostrils.

You start to run ...\#
;
;
\I017#Criss Cross\#
;
\K017#You meet a very old man. You tell him of your
quest and he says "Go to the old monestry. St.
Quentin was it's patron. There, somewhere in
the ruins of the old chapell you'll find the
sword of Mhrutin, the dwarf who lived with the
monks. It is a dragon sword! It is called 'The
Threat of Rharfanijawo', for with it's powers
Mhrutin himself has once not only killed
Tranguard the Dragon of the High Hills, but
too, slaughtered all the outlaws in the place
called 'Rharfanijawo of the South'." You ask
him what the way would be. "South." he says.
"Walk south for four days or five."

You bid him farewell and turn south ...
;
;
\I018#Holes in the Ground\#
;
;\K018#Hell, this is a dangerous area!\#
;
;
\I019#Just One Chance\#
;
\K019#You come to the ruins of an ancient monestry.
This must be the place the old man told you
about. You start searching for the remains of
the chapell and Mhrutins sword within.

Suddenly you realize you're not alone.
Something or rather someone is running this
way and that ...\#
;
;
\I020#Rocky River Running\#
;
;\K020#You've found the sword. Gosh! What a lovely,
glittering weapon it is. And sharpened, better
than a razor blade! You turn away from the
ruins of St. Quentin's monestry. Down the hill
a rocky river runs.\#
;
;
\I021#The City of Rarastapol\#
;
\K021#You arrive at Rarastapol, City of the Southern
Woods. There is not much life to be found. The
Dragon must have come across this place. And
it seems he did not pass by without saying a
firy, burning "hello" first.\#
;
;
\I022#Through the
Looking Glass\#
;
\K022#You enter one of the deserted houses. Most
furniture is broken, but on the wall a mirror
is hanging ...

Rarastapol\#
