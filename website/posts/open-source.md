Bad news first:
Unfortunately, the initial excitement of the public was a little underwhelming
(yes, probably our marketing was underwhelming too). 

Fortunately (good news): As we want to keep McMinos
inspite of this alive and also want to open it up for academic and research projects,
we are open sourcing it. We will keep paied versions around to fund potential further
development of the game. If we get enough money, we will also still offer compiled versions
of the iOS versions. The sources of McMinos are hosted on https://github.com/ulno/mcminos.
It is availabel under the GPLv3.
