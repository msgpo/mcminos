McMinos Online Manual
=====================

If you are a first-time player, we recommend that you try the tutorial levels,
currently shown at the top of the level list in the game's main menu. The
tutorial levels introduce many elements of the game step by step. Most of them
are easy to play, and also a nice testing area. If you play these, you may not
even need the documentation on this page. Enjoy!


Installation
============

Android
-------

Go to Google Play and get the teaser or the full version of McMinos. Just tap the install button on the McMinos page in Google Play. It will be downloaded and installed after asking you for permission.


iOS
---

Go to Apple's iTunes App Store and get the teaser or the ful version of McMinos. Install from there just as you would do with any other App from the App Store.


The main menu
=============

Here you can select the tutorial levels or a level category. There are also
options to modify settings (language, sound, etc.) and, most importantly, an
exit button. But be aware that you need not exit McMinos to perform other tasks
- like accepting a phone call on your smart phone - McMinos will just lie back
in the background and you can start again just where you paused after you have
finished whatever it was you were doing.

|Main menu|


The settings button and menu
----------------------------

In the top left corner of the main screen you find a settings button sporting
three sliders as you may know them from studio mixers. If you tap on this
button, a menu with several buttons pops up - from left to right:

* sound (on|off)
* music (on|off)
* zoom main menu & toolbox in|out (i.e. increase|decrease symbols and text size)
* switch language (currently: English|German)
* abort

As these buttons do just what they claim to do, we hope that no further
discussion is needed. Should be be wrong, please let us know.


The load button
---------------

The load corresponds to the save button you will find in the level screen's
toolbox menu. After you have saved a game manually from inside the game screen,
you will be able to load that saved game using the load button on the main
screen. This means that the load button has no function until a game has been
saved. Pressing it at first program start is futile. ;-)

Be aware that this save&load function is independent of the program's automatic
persistence functionality. While the latter will provide automatic resumption
of the game exactly where you left it when the program was last closed, aborted
or crashed (may not always work in the last case), the save&load functionality
offers a second slot to put a game state it.

So, if you have saved a game and shortly after abort the program you may either
continue playing from where you were when the program stopped or actively go to
the main menu and load the previously saved game state. *The saved game will
persist until it is overwritten with a new game state through the game screen's
save option.*


The info button
---------------

Tapping the info button will open a screen with some information on McMinos and
it's creators, including credits and some statistics.


Exit button
-----------

Do we really have to explain this one? We chose the emergency exit symbol for a
reason.


The level sets
--------------


The tutorial levels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


This is the first set of levels presented to the player at first program start.
We strongly recommend that you play these tutorial levels. And do read the
introductions, they are not overly long and give hints on how to use the
introduced items.

1. Peas'n'walls
2. Ghost "Hanky"
3. Chocolate Take Away
4. Of doors and keys
5. Rock, rock me, baby!
6. Go, get the jumping peas!
7. It's a bomb!
8. Small holes, big holes
9. Warp holes
10. Potions good and bad
11. Dynamite
12. One-Ways
13. Mirror, mirror on the wall ...
14. Speedy race
15. Don't drink and ...
16. Infinite world
17. The mine is mine
18. Playground

The final "Playground" level presents all introduced elements in one level,
just to play around with them and have fun. Think of this level as a sandbox,
just as is common with many wiki wiki systems.


The teaser version of McMinos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The free "teaser" version of McMinos has five levels for you to enjoy. We try
to present diverse types of levels of increasing difficulty. We hope you enjoy
them as much as we do.

Just like the tutorial levels, the teaser levels have a short introductory
text. It may contain a hint on how to solve the level. Read it.

The paid version of McMinos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The paid version of McMinos has two categories of levels to play:

1. McMinos is alive!

2. A level up

They provide 20 levels each, and of increasing difficulty. Again, just like the
tutorial levels, most of the levels in these series have a short introduction
displayed at level start. It may or may not provide useful hints. Read it at
your own risk.

Have fun!


The game screen
===============

The game screen mainly consists of the level area. In addition you find a
toolbar on the left hand side, some symbols and status bars at the top,
depending on which items are active, and a mini map of the level that usually
resides in the top left corner as an overlay on the level area. The mini map
will only be displayed if the level is larger at the currend zoom level than
what fits on your devices display. I.e.: if you zoom out enough, the mini map
may disappear.

The toolbar
-----------

The toolbar sits on the left edge of the game screen. It carries two important
buttons and is the container where collected items from the level are stored
until you use them.

The play & pause button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The settings button
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


The collectibles area of the toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. chocolate
2. key
3. bomb
4. dynamite
5. mine
6. umbrella
7. medicine
